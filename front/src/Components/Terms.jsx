          <h3>
            1. The digital asset is not issued by any financial institution,
            company, or by this website itself.
          </h3>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}></p>
          <h3>
            2. The digital asset market is relatively new and still in its
            infancy. It remains unconfirmed in terms of widespread acceptance
            and stability. Consequently, there is a possibility that it may not
            experience significant growth or achieve the anticipated levels of
            adoption and success.
          </h3>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}></p>

          <h3>
            3. Digital assets are primarily utilized by speculators, with
            relatively limited use in retail and commercial markets.
            Transactions in digital assets carry extremely high risks. Trading
            occurs continuously throughout the day without any interruptions or
            price limits, making prices highly susceptible to manipulation by
            market makers and the influence of global governments. As a result,
            policy changes can cause significant price fluctuations.
          </h3>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}></p>

          <h3>
            4. Digital asset trading carries extremely high risks and is not
            suitable for most people. You acknowledge that engaging in such
            transactions may result in partial or total loss of your investment.
            Therefore, you should only trade with an amount that you can afford
            to lose. You also understand that digital assets can involve
            derivative risks. If you have any doubts, it is recommended that you
            seek the assistance of a professional advisor before proceeding. In
            addition to the risks mentioned, there are also unpredictable risks.
            You should carefully consider these risks and use sound judgment to
            evaluate your financial situation before making any decision to buy
            or sell digital assets. You will bear all the losses arising from
            such decisions. We do not assume any responsibility for these
            losses.

            have violated this agreement or that the services provided by this
            website, or your use of these services, are illegal according to the
            laws of your jurisdiction. This includes suspending or terminating

            nature of internet reliability and availability, we cannot be held
